# axle run: what a service needs, started first. A database it talks to (from its .env:
# DATABASE_URL=postgres://...@localhost:5432/..., REDIS_URL=redis://localhost, ...) that
# isn't answering, and that the project's compose file has: `docker compose up -d <it>`,
# then a wait for its port (up to 30 s). Or say it: `axle run set needs db redis` (compose
# services, started each time; compose leaves running ones as they are).
#
# Starting it runs the project's compose file, so it's asked the first time (like any of the
# project's commands; --yes or AXLE_RUN_TRUST=always don't ask). Without docker, or a
# compose service for it, it's said, and the service runs anyway.
