# The axle tool's core: its own command events (so it works under any prompt), the hooks
# API built on them, and the shared command history that suggest, jump, search and stats
# read.
#
# Hooks
#   axle hook <event> <function>   axle hook rm <event> <function>   axle hook ls
#   command-start  before a command runs              $1 = the command line
#   command-done   after it finishes                  $1 = exit code, $2 = seconds, $3 = command
#   prompt         before each prompt is drawn
#   dir            the directory changed              $1 = new directory
#   expand         Alt-i toggled (Benzene)            $1 = 1 expanded, 0 collapsed
#   run-start      axle run started something         $1 = name, $2 = folder, $3 = kind
#   run-ready      a service it started answers       $1 = name, $2 = URL, $3 = port
#   run-crash      it failed                          $1 = name, $2 = exit code
#   run-stop       it stopped or finished             $1 = name
#   (run-*: in the shell that started it; modules/run/yours.zsh)
#   During command-done, $_axle_ev_dir is where the command ran and $_axle_ev_prev the
#   command before it.
#
# History
#   Every command is appended to ${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/axle/history, one line
#   each: epoch <TAB> exit <TAB> seconds <TAB> dir <TAB> previous command <TAB> command
#   (newlines in commands written as \n). Lines typed with a leading space aren't recorded.
